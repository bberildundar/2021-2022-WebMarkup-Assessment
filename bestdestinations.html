            <p>
                Holidays to Cancun pack plenty in. On top of the sand beaches, there are great bars, modern shopping malls and plenty of Mayan ruins to explore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back in the Seventies, Cancun was just a small fishing town on the northeast coast of Mexico&#39;s Yucatan Peninsula. Today, it&#39;s a huge resort that comes in two parts. There&#39;s the downtown area with its markets and local cantinas, and then you&#39;ve
                got the Hotel Zone that comes with restaurants, shopping malls and nightclubs &#8208; and an extra-long strip of beach.
            </p>
            <p>
                The average price of a 7-day trip to Cancun is &euro;1,100 for a solo traveler.

                World-class beaches, desert islands and historical towns are part and parcel of Punta Cana holidays.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three S&#39;s sum up the state of play in Punta Cana. The sun, sea and sand on the Dominican Republic&#39;s eastern edge are rated among the best in the world. More than 50 miles of white-sand coast runs from Bavaro to Uvero and beyond. And most of
                it&#39;s backed by coconut-bearing palm trees &#8208; earning this region the title of the Coconut Coast.
            </p>
            <p>
                In between learning how to surf and scuba diving around coral reefs and shipwrecks, you&#39;ll find plenty of things to do on land, as well. Punta Cana&#39;s home to over a dozen golf courses, some of which have been designed by Jack Nicklaus, one of
                the best golfers of all time.

            <p>
                Perched on the Red Sea Riviera, Egypt&#39;s second-largest city deals in pretty coral reefs, toast-coloured beaches and upmarket hotels. Scuba diving and snorkelling are popular activities here, due to the colourful sea life and clear water. There&#39;s
                also a world-class watersports scene, with scuba diving at the top of the list. Elsewhere, you&#39;ll find a grade-A dining scene &#8208; particularly around its stylish marina. If this all sounds like your cup of tea, hop on one of our
                direct flights to Hurghada from London Gatwick or Manchester. They take around six hours, and Hurghada Airport&#39;s a 15-minute drive from the city.

                It's no surprise holidays to Tenerife are so popular worldwide. The island offers up huge beaches, year-round sunshine and city-sized resorts.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the most popular Canary Island, Tenerife knows a thing or two about summer holidays. The secret of its success starts with its beaches. On the island&#39;s south coast, big resorts like Playa de las Americas, Los Cristianos and Costa Adeje have something
                going on around the clock. There are white sands and watersports to see you through the day and a world&#39;s worth of restaurants and bars to move you through the night.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tourism limelight shines a little softer on the resorts on the west and north coast. Days in Playa de la Arena, for example, revolve around the sleepy volcanic beach, and nights play out in beachside restaurants.

                Banjul &#8208; one blink and you&#39;ll miss it. Trace your finger south from the Canaries and you&#39;ll come across this tiny West African nation, surrounded by Senegal on all three sides. It may only be 31 miles at its widest point, but what it lacks
                in size, it more than makes up for in personality. It&#39;s dubbed the Smiling Coast of Africa, thanks to its friendly locals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most tourists are drawn to The Gambia&#39;s crowd-free coastline. Picture long strips of pale sand that go on and on all gazing out across the Atlantic Ocean. The high priests of the 50-mile-long shoreline are undoubtedly Kotu and Kololi. These sun-soaked
                sweeps are big, bold and bustling with action. Here, the sands are accompanied by craft markets and strips of bars and restaurants, where you can tuck in to everything from Lebanese cuisine to Gambian delicacies.

            <p>
                A holiday to Lapland is the ultimate Christmas present. This is the one place in the world that little ones can spend time with Santa on his home turf.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lapland is located in northernmost Finland, deep inside the Arctic Circle. Flights from London to Lapland are around three and a half hours long. Known as Santa Claus&#39; homeland, this country dishes up the stuff of fairytales like snow-dusted forests,
                cosy log cabins, and a population that&#39;s made up of more reindeer than people. Lapland&#39;s snowy countryside was made for exploring and, wherever you stay, winter sports like snowmobiling are as easy to come by as Christmassy activities.
                Each resort has a different vibe, too, so whether you&#39;re after an action-packed getaway or a relaxing retreat, you&#39;ll find somewhere that suits.
